Airline stocks since Covid-19 Pandemic began

This weekend during Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, Warren Buffet announced that the company sold off all of its stakes in airlines.  Noting that "Our airline position was a mistake", Buffet stated that there are too many planes in the industry, and passenger rates will not recover in the next few years.



I decided to make a site to show how all of the airlines currently trading on the NYSE have been affected throughout the year, specifying Covid-19 related events..  First I created a time series graph to show the daily movement of these stocks since the beginning of the year.  Secondly, I created a bar chart with user input to show the percent change of a stock from when the event occurred to today.



Dash is a great tool to use when showing data visualization, especially when user input is needed.  The graphs are fully interactive and adjust the axes and lines seamlessly with simple interaction.  Hovering, zooming and selecting will all update immediately without requiring a page load.



Take a look at my site to see how responsive graphs can be from a client-side perspective when coded with Dash.
